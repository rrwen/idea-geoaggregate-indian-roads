Fortunately, [DIVA-GIS](https://www.diva-gis.org/) provides us with geospatial data of administrative boundaries and roads for free (all in one easily accessible website - pretty awesome!).

To implement this idea, I will be providing a brief guide to geospatially aggregating (or geoaggregating) roads by state/UT. The aggregation will involve some
